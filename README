Project home page: http://jebaird.com/blog/dragtable-jquery-ui-widget-re-arrange-table-columns-drag-drop


#Getting started development

dragtable uses funcunit for functional testing so you will need to do the following. These steps aren't necessary if you just want to use the widget.

fork this repo and run

git submodule init

git submodule update
	this should pull down
		https://github.com/bitovi/steal
		https://github.com/bitovi/funcunit

this should pull down steal and funcunit 

then go into funcunit/ and run the same commands

you should be already for testing and development
